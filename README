                               EEGDEV



Presentation
============

eegdev is a library that provides an interface for accessing various EEG
(and other biosignals) acquisition systems in a unified way. The interface
has been designed in order to be both flexible and efficient. The device
specific part is implemented by the means of plugins which makes adding
new device backend fairly easy even if the library does not support them yet
officially.

The core library not only provides a unified and consistent interfaces to
the eegdev users but it also provides many functionalities to the
device backends (plugins) ranging from configuration to data casting and
scaling making writing new device backend an easy task.


Supported devices
=================

As of now, the library support the following backend:

 - Biosemi ActiveTwo
 - gTec gUSBamp
 - reading biosignal data file
 - Tobi network Interface A


Supported platforms
===================

This depends on which device the library should support. The core library
supports any POSIX platform and Windows. All device backend are supported on
these platforms excepting from the gTec gUSBamp device which is, as of now, 
supported only on Linux i386/amd64 platforms.
